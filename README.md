# ❤️ Valentine's Surprise for Your GF

This website is ready to be hosted on GitHub! Atharva, follow these exact steps to make it live:

### 1. Upload the files
Make sure all the files I just gave you (including the `.github` folder) are uploaded to your GitHub repository.

### 2. Enable GitHub Actions Hosting
This is the most important part:
1.  Go to your repository on GitHub.com.
2.  Click the **Settings** tab at the top.
3.  On the left menu, click **Pages**.
4.  Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, change the dropdown from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**.

### 3. Wait and Share!
1.  Click the **Actions** tab at the top of your repository. You should see a workflow running named "Deploy to GitHub Pages".
2.  Wait for it to finish (it will turn green).
3.  Go back to **Settings > Pages**, and you will see your live link!

### 📸 How to add YOUR photos
1.  Upload your photos to a site like [Imgur](https://imgur.com).
2.  Right-click the image on Imgur and select "Copy Image Address" (it should end in `.jpg` or `.png`).
3.  Open `App.tsx` here.
4.  Find the `PHOTOS` array (around line 22) and replace the links inside the quotes with your Imgur links.
5.  Save and commit the changes to GitHub. The site will update automatically!
